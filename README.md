Quick notes on website function:

Relevant files are titled: index.html, product_page.html, product_list.html, sign_in_page.html, stylesheet.css

1. On the homepage, you can get to the product list page by either clicking on the “Shop Now” link 
on the hero image, or by going to “Pillows” in the “Decor” dropdown.

2. On the Product List Page, only the “Round Pillows” link is functional. 
This will take you to the Product Details Page.

3. On the Product Details Page, when you click “Add to Cart” this will automatically 
take you to the Sign-in/Checkout as Guest page (this is how it’s currently set up, but 
once we fold in JS, I will change this functionality).

4. The Fluff Stuff logo will always take you Home.
